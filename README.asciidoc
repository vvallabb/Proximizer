= Proximizer
iBeacon proximity experiments.

Currently changes the background color of the app based on the distance to three beacons. Each beacon represents the one RGB color part. 

== Parameters
Works best with a minimum iBeacon transmission interval, 50 ms for Estimote beacons (which will also drain your beacon's battery). 
The beacon UUIDs and Major/Minor IDs are hardcoded currently.
The values are:

* All beacons: Estimote UUID ()
* All beacons: Major 1
* R: Minor 1
* G: Minor 2
* B: Minor 3


Will possibly add the capability to make sounds and evolve into something that turns your dancing into bleeps and blinks.
